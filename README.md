## Description

SVG Logo Generator is a Node.js command-line application that allows users to easily create simple SVG logos. A SVG file will be generated in the current directory based on the user's selections for text, shape, and color prompts, which can be opened with any web browser.

## Installation and Usage

Use the `npm i` command to install dependencies.

Run the application using the `node index.js` command in the terminal.

Follow the prompts, selecting how you want your logo to look:

- Enter up to 3 characters for the logo's text.
- Enter a color for the text.
- Select a shape (circle, triangle, square).
- Enter a color for the shape.

When all prompts are completed, a SVG file named 'logo.svg' will be automatically generated in the current directory. Open the generated SVG file in any web browser to view your logo.

## Testing

This application uses Jest for testing.

Install Jest by running the `npm i jest` command in the terminal.

Execute the `npm test` command to run tests for files with **'.test.js'** at the end of the filename.
